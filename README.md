DialectSurvey
=============

This project is currently a work in progress.  I am attempting to take the data collected through the dialect survey and represent it in a much more intuitive manner.  My first goal is, for each survey question, to display the majority response for each state.  This will give a more interesting view of the underlying data.


To download the raw html files for each state, run python downloader.py

To build the Cassandra database run extractor.py
